<p><strong>The Balloon Expanding and Self-Expanding Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balloon Expanding Stents</li><li>Self-Expanding Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Balloon expanding and self-expanding stents are two primary types of vascular stents used in medical procedures to maintain vessel patency. Balloon expanding stents are deployed using a catheter with an inflatable balloon that expands the stent against the vessel wall, providing a rigid structure for support. In contrast, self-expanding stents are designed to automatically expand upon deployment, adapting to the vessel diameter and providing continuous radial support. Both types are essential in treating blockages and improving blood flow in various vascular conditions.</p></p>
