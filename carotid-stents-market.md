<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carotid Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balloon Expandable Stents</li><li>Self-Expanding Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The carotid stents market features two primary types: balloon-expandable stents and self-expanding stents. Balloon-expandable stents are deployed using a balloon catheter that expands the stent to fit the artery, providing precise placement and strong support but requiring careful handling. In contrast, self-expanding stents are designed to expand automatically upon deployment, allowing for easier insertion and adaptability to varying artery diameters. Both types aim to prevent carotid artery stenosis and reduce the risk of stroke, catering to different patient needs and anatomical scenarios.</p></p>
