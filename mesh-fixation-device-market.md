<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mesh Fixation Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Fixation Device</li><li>Non-Absorbable Fixation Device</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The mesh fixation device market consists of two primary types: absorbable and non-absorbable fixation devices. Absorbable fixation devices gradually break down and are absorbed by the body over time, reducing the need for surgical removal and minimizing long-term complications. In contrast, non-absorbable fixation devices provide permanent support and stability, maintaining their structure within the body indefinitely. Both types are essential in various surgical procedures, including hernia repairs and tissue reinforcement, catering to specific patient needs and surgical preferences.</p></p>
