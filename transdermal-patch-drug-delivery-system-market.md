<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transdermal Patch Drug Delivery System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shunt Way</li><li>Intercellular Lipid Structure Pathway</li><li>Trans-cellular Pathway</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The transdermal patch drug delivery system comprises three primary market types: the shunt way, intercellular lipid structure pathway, and trans-cellular pathway. The shunt way bypasses skin layers, allowing drugs to enter quickly. The intercellular lipid structure pathway utilizes the lipid matrix between skin cells, facilitating drug absorption through natural skin barriers. The trans-cellular pathway enables drugs to permeate directly through skin cells, optimizing bioavailability. Each pathway offers unique advantages, influencing the design and effectiveness of transdermal patches in therapeutic applications.</p></p>
